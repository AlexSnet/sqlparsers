Early stage!..  
All original and new tests parses though.

These parsers are just extractions from other projects.

The cheers and applauses for great work done, goes to (in that order):

### The MySQL query parser:  
The guys at YouTube for creating [vitess](https://github.com/youtube/vitess)  

Most of the extracted codes origin: [/youtube/vitess/tree/master/go/vt/sqlparser](https://github.com/youtube/vitess/tree/master/go/vt/sqlparser)

### The Postgres query parser:  
The guys at [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach) took the above code and ran with it.  
What they've created is a Postgres compatible parser! T.H.A.N.K.  Y.O.U. ! ! !  

Most of the extracted codes origin: [/cockroachdb/cockroach/tree/master/pkg/sql/parser](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/tree/master/pkg/sql/parser)
